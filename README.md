# 🧠 ALX Project Nexus

## 📘 Project Objective
**ALX Project Nexus** serves as a documentation hub for my major learnings and milestones from the **ProDev Backend Engineering Program**.  
It highlights my understanding of backend engineering concepts, tools, and best practices while showcasing my ability to design, develop, and deploy scalable backend systems.

---

## 🚀 Program Overview
The **ProDev Backend Engineering Program** is a comprehensive learning journey designed to equip participants with advanced backend development skills.  
Through a series of milestones — including the full-scale **Airbnb Project** — learners master essential backend technologies and software engineering principles.

The **Project Nexus** capstone project allows me to apply these skills in building a **real-world audiobook platform backend system**, demonstrating technical expertise, problem-solving ability, and readiness for professional opportunities.
